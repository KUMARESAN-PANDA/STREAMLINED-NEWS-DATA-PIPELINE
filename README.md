Key Components:


Target Sources: Identify a list of reputable news websites and RSS feeds to scrape content from.

Scraping Framework: Utilize web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium to extract news articles, headlines, publication dates, authors, and other relevant metadata.

Data Extraction: Implement parsers for different news sites to handle varying HTML structures and ensure reliable data extraction.
